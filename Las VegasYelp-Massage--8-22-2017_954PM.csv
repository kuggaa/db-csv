Thai massage uses passive stretching and gentle pressure along the body’s energy lines to increase flexibility, relieve muscle and joint tension and balance the body’s energy systems. Thai massage is both deeply relaxing and energizing.Thai massage takes place on a futon mat on the floor, and you wear loose fitting clothing. During your Thai massage, You start by laying on your back, and the therapist uses gentle compression and stretching techniques to open up your body, beginning with you legs. Some people say Thai massage is a little like doing yoga without any effort, because the therapist will push your body into various positions without any work on your part.Thai massage is done with all your clothes on, so some people recommend it if you feel uncomfortable with nudity during a Swedish massage.Meet the Business Owner",Wanpen S.,Yes,No,4.5 star rating,38 reviews,http://www.thaimassagelasvegas.com/,Moderate,Mon 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Tue 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Wed 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Thu 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Fri 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Sat 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>Sun 11:00 am - 11:00 pm<br>,,,,Yes,,Private Lot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,"Day Spas, Massage, Day Spas, Massage",36.126545,-115.219208,"https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6mvqRejdIh7zwIBzwdYrtw/ls.jpg"" srcset=""https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6mvqRejdIh7zwIBzwdYrtw/258s.jpg 1.03x,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6mvqRejdIh7zwIBzwdYrtw/348s.jpg 1.39x,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6mvqRejdIh7zwIBzwdYrtw/300s.jpg 1.20x",http://www.yelp.com/biz/lavish-spa-las-vegas?osq=Massage,,,,,,

I amBoard Certified as a Massage Therapist and have completed advanced training in Sports Massage,Injury Recovery, Prenatal Massage, and have reached a level 3 in Trigger point therapy. Receiving Certification through NAT Institute.I love helping anyone who suffers from pain. Through a series of treatments, I have been able to help clients return to their regular activities and live pain free. I don't offer just a massage, it is a real healing session. Although most call me for specific bodywork, I do accommodate regular therapeutic modalities as well. If I don't have an opening,I can recommend a great therapeutic Massage therapist.HistoryEstablished in 2010.My business started in 2010 with a strong passion to become a SPA owner. While seeing how beneficial Massage was to my clients I decided to go into specialty practice offering Medical Massage.Since then I have been entrusted with many clients who are not able to move freely without pain. I am constantly in awe of the way the body is able to heal and over come major issues once the restrictions are released. Thank you for the opportunity to work with you. I assure you that I will utilize every skill, and give the adequate attention to every specific need towards healing.Meet the Business Owner",Marissa G.,Yes,No,5.0 star rating,17 reviews,http://www.thespa2u.com,,Mon 10:00 am - 9:00 pm<br>Tue 10:00 am - 9:00 pm<br>Wed 10:00 am - 9:30 pm<br>Thu 10:00 am - 8:00 pm<br>Fri 10:00 am - 10:00 pm<br>Sat 9:00 am - 10:00 pm<br>Sun 1:00 pm - 8:30 pm<br>,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,"Reflexology, Massage Therapy, Yoga, Skin Care, Massage, Cycling Classes, Reflexology, Massage Therapy",36.107535,-115.177297,"https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKH1tGUs4ecbMJEu-V-dDg/ls.jpg"" srcset=""https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKH1tGUs4ecbMJEu-V-dDg/258s.jpg 1.03x,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKH1tGUs4ecbMJEu-V-dDg/348s.jpg 1.39x,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKH1tGUs4ecbMJEu-V-dDg/300s.jpg 1.20x",http://www.yelp.com/biz/thespa2u-las-vegas?osq=Massage,,,,,,

Walk-ins welcome!HistoryEstablished in 2016.The Right Massage, Every Time!What is now a national brand began years ago when Michele Merhib - a certified massage therapist - had a dream to make massage available to everyone - not just the well to do. She also wanted to create a unique environment for massage therapy professionals to help people heal themselves. She started by renting space in a local country club where she set up a massage table and a massage chair to serve a number of regular customers. Then she went out on her own, opening a full-fledged retail location in Aurora, Colorado. The success of her Aurora studio soon spawned a second location in Centennial, Colorado with 45 employees, and more than 1,300 massage sessions a month. Today Elements Massage is one of the fastest-growing massage franchises in America.
