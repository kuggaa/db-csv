This is the cannabis experience you've been looking for.HistoryEstablished in 2014.From our flagship Downtown Denver dispensary, to our newly opened medical marijuana centers in Colorado Springs and Littleton, the Native Roots footprint in Colorado continues to expand. Our goal is to change the perception of marijuana, its consumption, while showcasing the medicinal benefits of the cannabis plant, in addition to the ways cannabis can be included in daily life as an lifesaving alternative medicine.With an ever-growing presence across Colorado, we are working to make legal cannabis accessible to all regions from Denver to the High Country.
